Welcome to MuseRed's documentation!
===================================

.. note::
   This is a work in progress !!

The aim of this project is to provide tools to reduce more easily MUSE
datasets, and for doing an "advanced" data reduction, similar to the HUDF one.
It handles the retrieval of the data from the ESO archive, and stores all the
metadata extracted from FITS headers in a database. Then it allows to run the
recipes from the MUSE pipeline on the calibrations and science exposures.
