Welcome to MuseRed's documentation!
===================================

.. note::
   This is a work in progress !!

The aim of this project is to provide tools to reduce more easily MUSE
datasets, and for doing an "advanced" data reduction, similar to the HUDF one.
It handles the retrieval of the data from the ESO archive, and stores all the
metadata extracted from FITS headers in a database. Then it allows to run the
recipes from the MUSE pipeline on the calibrations and science exposures.

Installation
============

.. warning::
   Currently we need a development version of `astroquery`_, it can be
   installed with::

     pip install --pre "astroquery>0.3.8"

First, clone the repository and install the package::

    pip install .

Settings
========

All the configuration must be done in a YAML file, by default ``settings.yml``
in the current directory. This file contains all the settings about
directories, global options, parameters for the *musered* commands, and for the
reduction recipes.

A `settings file example <./docs/settings.yml>`_ can be found in the ``docs``
folder.

One important thing in the organisation of the reduction is the concept of
*dataset*. This defines a set of files that are retrieved and reduced together.
For instance to define a `IC4406` dataset (observed during WFM-AO
commissioning)::

    datasets:
      IC4406:
        archive_filter:
          # "column_filters" passed to astroquery.Eso.query_instrument
          obs_targ_name: IC4406

See below for the meaning of *archive_filter*.

About the command-line interface
================================

Every step can be run with sub-commands of the ``musered`` command. It is also
possible to setup completion (using `click-completion`_, TODO: explain), or to
run the subcommands in a REPL with ``musered repl`` (after installing
`click-repl`_).

Data retrieval
==============

Retrieving a dataset is done with `Astroquery
<https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eso/eso.html>`__. To find all the
possible query options for Muse, to use in the *archive_filter* for your
dataset, use this::

    $ musered retrieve_data --help-query

Once a dataset is defined in the settings file, its data files can be retrieved
with this command::

    $ musered retrieve_data IC4406

Note that this also retrieve the calibration files associated to the data. And
all files are placed in a unique directory (defined by the ``raw_path``
setting), which allows to avoid duplicating files for different datasets.

Ingesting metadata in a database
================================

Then the next step is to ingest FITS keywords in a SQLite database. This step
is triggered automatically by the ``retrieve_data`` command, but it can also be
run manually if needed, with::

    $ musered update_db

Running recipes
===============

Calibrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Processing the calibrations is done with the ``musered process_calib`` command.
The different steps can be run for a given night or for all nights, and the
``--skip`` parameter allows to avoid reprocessing the nights that have already
been processed.

The currently available steps and the related command-line options are:

- ``muse_bias``: ``--bias``
- ``muse_dark``: ``--dark``
- ``muse_flat``: ``--flat``
- ``muse_wavecal``: ``--wavecal``
- ``muse_lsf``: ``--lsf``

By default, when no option is given, all steps except ``muse_dark`` are run.
The ``MASTER_DARK`` frames are also excluded from the inputs of the other
recipes.

For instance, to run the ``muse_bias`` recipe for a given night::

    $ musered process_calib --bias 2017-06-15

Or to run ``muse_flat`` recipe for all nights, skipping already processed
nights::

    $ musered process_calib --flat --skip
